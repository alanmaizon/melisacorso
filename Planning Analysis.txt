Subject: Artist Website for Melisa Corso

Goal: A Single Page Website for Melisa Corso.
Give focus, direction, and action to the proyect;
Provide a clear and concise message to the customer.

I want to position Melisa with an modern approach website:

"Parallax scrolling is a technique where background content moves 
at a different speed than foreground content, 
creating an illusion of depth and a more dynamic visual experience. 

This small but impactful design choice enhances storytelling, 
guides the user journey through the website, 
and increases engagement by providing a unique user experience."
